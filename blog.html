      <h2> HOW TO SURVIVE OKTOBERFEST </h2>
        <p> By <span class="blue"> Eve Jenkins</span>

    <p class="paragraph">Five days at Oktoberfest was something I wouldn’t do again.It was pure overkill. Even the group I was with, filled with able-bodied, hardened drinkers, was exhausted by day 3 and uninterested by day 5. By the end, I never wanted to see a beer again.But I survived the experience – and in the process had a great time, made a lot of new friends, hardened my liver, met some other cool travel bloggers,and learned just how to plan the perfect Oktoberfest trip.</p>
    <p>Oktoberfest was one of the best festivals I’ve ever attended. It’s a 16–18-day beer festival held annually in Munich, Germany, running from late September to the first weekend in October. It all began when Crown Prince Ludwig married Princess Therese on October 12, 1810.  The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city, which the locals call “Wies’n” (which means grass, and why Oktoberfest is nicknamed Wiesn in Germany)</p>
    <p>Ever since then, it has become a major event, especially in the last few decades as more and more international travelers have been attracted to the festival thanks to tours, cheap flights, and better accommodation options. It’s such a big thing that you’ll find Oktoberfest activities in cities around the world (though nothing beats the original).</p>

      <h2> SURVIVAL TIPS </h2>
        <img class="slideshow" src="https://heleneinbetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oktoberfest2017-e-10-of-16.jpg"style="width:100%">

    <p class="paragraph">It’s a marathon, not a sprint — you’ll be drinking all day, so there’s no need to rush it. Too many people pass out on the lawns by dinnertime. Pace yourself. Those liters of beer are strong.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Hydrate:</b> Drink a lot of water while you’re there. I had Powerade and water bottles lined up in my room for when I got home and when I woke up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get to the Käfer tent early:</b> Most of the tents close at 10:30pm. Käfer is the only one open until 1am, so everyone rushes there after the others shut down. Get there a bit before 10:30pm so you have a spot. Otherwise, you simply won’t be able to get in or get served.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get a table early:</b> No reservation? Just winging it? If you aren’t there by midday, your chances of finding a table shrink greatly. Try to avoid the times when they switch reservations. All the people that got kicked out are now looking for a free table, and competition is fierce.
        </li>
    </ul>

      <h2> SINGING </h2>
        <iframe width="675" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeV6qAEQEoE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p class="paragraph">….but no matter what, there’s a lot of singing.</p>
          <p>Outside the beer tents, you’ll find a carnival atmosphere. Literally. The grounds contain a carnival with games, rides, and even haunted houses. It is like a theme park in Anywhere, USA. If it wasn’t for people dressed up, you wouldn’t have known you were in Germany. (This is also where you’ll find everyone passed out from too much beer!)</p>
          <p>Inside the tents is where you find the traditional Oktoberfest you’ve come for: lots of hearty food, traditional music, large decorated tents, friendly people, large steins of beer, and communal happy atmosphere that breeds friendship and joy! Everyone is here for a good time and in high spirits!</p>
          <p>Oktoberfest only happens once a year, and though it sort of busted my European budget, I don’t regret any of the money I spent. I’m really glad after years of false starts that I finally got to visit and celebrate Oktoberfest. My friends and I are already considering returning next year (though maybe not for five days again).</p>
