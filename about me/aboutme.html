            <p>Hi, I'm sarah a travel enthusiast and an archaeologist, I've been hiking the world'd most striking footpaths/pilgramiges/trails for 10 years. With no plans to stop I have complied a list of my adventures with tips, and route journeys. Everything I know from my adventures, an online diary and a tool for others struck by the wanderlust bug to find their next adventure</p>
            <p>At 19 I left home, my first big travel journey began in Europe, I spent 8 months exploring the continent. Once I began I couldn't stop</p>
